# [namanaman.github.io](http://namanaman.github.io)

My personal site designed & developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Features a simple one-page review of my past work, my online presence, and my taste in music. The design was intended to be colorful & simplistic in nature. I hope to add more to this page in the future!

Feel free to use this as a template for your own sites.
