## About this page
My personal site designed & developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Features a simple one-page review of my past work, my online presence, and my taste in music. The design was intended to be clean and simple in nature, where the reader can quickly and easily read it and learn about my work. I hope to add more to this page in the future!

## Design
Feel free to use this as a template for your own sites, and see the evolution of the design below.

#### January 2017
Updated the look to clearly define and separate each block of information, while keeping the design flat and clean. I removed the highlighting on hover for the different blocks to take away any confusion that they were actually links. Now, only links will highlight on hover.

#### January 2016
One of the more initial designs for the site, inspired by a more tabular, blocky format to clearly represent hierarchy of information, but clearly not as visually pleasing with so many lines everywhere.

## Things to do
* Add travel map of where I've been and want to go
